###########Blackboard and Google Slides discussion script

v1.0: 

input: copy of text from blackboard "collection" or a Google slides comment
thread.

output: data frame with student names, # of posts, # of days posted, and word 
count

for Blackboard, it's passable
for Google Slides, it's brittle... not clear-cut 'identifiers' for comment text

to-do: 
patch up Google slide version better
input class lists automatically
output as ready-to-upload spreadsheet
input prompts for grade comments
(ie, merge the R + Excel parts of the grading
